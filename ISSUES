ISSUES/BUGS
============

* Current design requires 2 plugin handlers. Why
   not 1? Abstraction.
* Genre Modifications client side? Is there any 
   point having plugins on server? In this case,
   why does server exist?
      - But then what do we allow client side?
      - More stringent requirements need to be
         resolved.
